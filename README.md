# TMDB MCP Server

An MCP server for The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It provides movie and TV search, streaming availability, cast and crew details, and recommendations for assistants such as Codex and Claude Desktop.

For the architecture split between the reusable MCP server and higher-level feature workflows, see [USERGUIDE.md](USERGUIDE.md).

## Tools

### Movie Discovery

## Quick Start

1. Get a TMDB API key at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) → Account Settings → API

2. Clone, install, and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Laksh-star/mcp-server-tmdb.git
   cd mcp-server-tmdb
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a local env file and add your TMDB key:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Install the local Codex and Claude Desktop integration:
   ```bash
   npm run install:local
   ```

5. Restart Codex or Claude Desktop if already open.

6. Verify with a prompt like:
   ```text
   What movies are trending this week?
   ```

In Codex, a fresh session should show `TMDB` in the plugin list and expose the `mcp__tmdb__` namespace.

## Tool Surface Smoke

Use this smoke test after adding or merging tools. It verifies the expected MCP tool contract and calls the main workflow tools: `compare_movies`, `find_where_to_watch`, `get_weekend_watchlist`, `plan_watch_party`, `build_franchise_watch_order`, `build_collection_gap_plan`, `recommend_from_taste_profile`, and `build_person_watch_path`.

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run smoke:tools
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/tool-surface-smoke.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp
```

The script writes a compact verification artifact to:

```text
examples/tool-surface-smoke.md
```

To avoid tool bloat, prefer adding workflow tools that combine multiple TMDB calls into a useful user decision. Keep raw endpoint-style tools only when they are broadly reusable primitives.

## Weekly Trending Language Demo

This repo includes a small shareable demo that calls the MCP tool `get_weekly_trending_by_language`, which fetches live TMDB weekly trending movies and groups the current first page by TMDB `original_language`.

Run it against the local stdio MCP server:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:weekly-trending
```

After deploying this version of the Worker, run the same demo against a remote MCP endpoint:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/weekly-trending-languages.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp
```

If the deployment is intentionally authless for personal testing, omit `TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## Weekly Streaming Radar

This repo also includes a script-first weekly radar. It chains existing MCP tools into a Markdown artifact with movie trends, TV trends, language momentum, action-ready picks, family-safe picks, and a taste-profile probe.

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:weekly-radar -- --country US
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/weekly-streaming-radar.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --country US
```

The script writes:

```text
examples/weekly-streaming-radar.md
```

## Release Calendar Watchlist

The release calendar is also script-first. It creates a Markdown artifact for upcoming or recent release-window scanning, watch-later candidates, family-safe baselines, and provider probes.

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:release-calendar -- --country US --days 90
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/release-calendar-watchlist.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --country US --days 90
```

The script writes:

```text
examples/release-calendar-watchlist.md
```

## Provider Change Monitor

The provider monitor is script-first because it needs persisted state. It calls `find_where_to_watch`, compares the current provider list against a JSON snapshot, and writes a Markdown delta report showing new, removed, unchanged, and missing provider availability.

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:provider-monitor -- --country US --titles "The Matrix,Inception" --services "Netflix,Prime Video"
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/provider-change-monitor.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --country US --titles "The Matrix,Inception" --services "Netflix,Prime Video"
```

The script writes:

```text
examples/provider-change-monitor.md
examples/provider-change-snapshot.json
```

## Collection Gap Finder

The collection gap finder script now calls the promoted MCP tool `build_collection_gap_plan` and writes a repeatable Markdown completion report with watched entries, missing entries, remaining runtime, provider availability, and a shortest completion path.

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:collection-gaps -- --franchise "The Matrix" --watched "The Matrix" --country US --services "Netflix,Prime Video"
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/collection-gap-finder.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --franchise "The Matrix" --watched "The Matrix" --country US --services "Netflix,Prime Video"
```

The script writes:

```text
examples/collection-gap-finder.md
```

## Remote MCP on Cloudflare Workers

This repo can also run as a remote MCP server on Cloudflare Workers. The remote server exposes the same TMDB tools at `/mcp` over Streamable HTTP, so Claude, Cowork, Claude Desktop connectors, and other remote-MCP clients can connect to a public URL.

The existing local stdio server remains unchanged for Codex and local Claude Desktop use. The Cloudflare entrypoint is `src/worker.ts`.

The Worker also serves a browser demo at `/`: **Weekend Watch Concierge**. It supports solo picks and Watch Party mode, then builds a ranked movie shortlist using TMDB discovery, trending, now-playing, credits, posters, and watch-provider data. The browser app also includes a Help drawer for Cloudflare usage and a Workflow Demos panel with commands for script-first artifacts such as Weekly Streaming Radar, Provider Change Monitor, and Collection Gap Finder.

The browser demo also includes an **MCP tool surface** panel that calls the deployed `/mcp` route, verifies the expected tool contract, and samples `compare_movies`, `find_where_to_watch`, `get_weekend_watchlist`, `plan_watch_party`, `build_franchise_watch_order`, `build_collection_gap_plan`, `recommend_from_taste_profile`, and `build_person_watch_path`.

![Weekend Watch Concierge Workflow Demos panel](docs/assets/weekend-watch-concierge-home.png)

![Weekend Watch Concierge Watch Party mode](docs/assets/weekend-watch-concierge-watch-party.png)

For the complete browser app, deployed Worker, access-token, and MCP handoff, see `docs/weekend-watch-concierge.md`.

### Deploy

1. Log in to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

2. Store your TMDB key as a Worker secret:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put TMDB_API_KEY
   ```

3. Store an access token as a Worker secret before sharing the deployment:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   When `ACCESS_TOKEN` is set, `POST /api/concierge` and `POST /mcp` require:
   ```text
   Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
   ```

4. Check the Worker bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run worker:dry-run
   ```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run worker:deploy
   ```

Cloudflare will print a URL like:

```text
https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Use this MCP endpoint in remote clients:

```text
https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp
```

Use this browser demo URL:

```text
https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/
```

### Connect from Claude / Cowork

For Claude custom connectors:

1. Open Claude settings: `Customize` -> `Connectors`.
2. Click `+` -> `Add custom connector`.
3. Use the deployed Worker MCP URL:
   ```text
   https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp
   ```
4. Enable the connector in a conversation and ask a TMDB question, such as:
   ```text
   What movies are trending this week?
   ```

For Claude Desktop versions or MCP clients that still require a local command, use the `mcp-remote` proxy:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tmdb-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Security note

If `ACCESS_TOKEN` is not configured, the Worker is authless for easy personal testing. Anyone who has the Worker URL can call the read-only TMDB tools and consume your TMDB API quota. Keep `ACCESS_TOKEN` configured or use Cloudflare Access before sharing this beyond your own accounts.

## Weekend Watch Concierge

Run the offline concierge test:

```bash
npm test
```

This builds the TypeScript project, starts a tiny local TMDB-compatible fixture server, and verifies that `createWeekendConcierge` ranks a requested streaming-service match first while respecting the runtime filter. It does not need a TMDB API key.

Run the Worker locally:

```bash
npm run worker:dev
```

This syncs local values from `.env` into an untracked `.dev.vars` file so Wrangler can expose `TMDB_API_KEY` to the Worker during local development.

For protected local testing, add `ACCESS_TOKEN` to `.env`. The browser app has an access-token field and the smoke scripts can read `ACCESS_TOKEN` or `TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the shell environment.

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

Smoke test the concierge API after the local Worker is running:

```bash
npm run smoke:concierge
```

Smoke test the remote MCP endpoint and call the agent-facing concierge tool:

```bash
node scripts/remote-mcp-smoke.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp --call-concierge
```

For a protected deployment:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/remote-mcp-smoke.mjs https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --call-concierge
```

Or test a deployed Worker:

```bash
node scripts/concierge-smoke.mjs https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

The app uses:

- `POST /api/concierge` for ranked movie picks
- `POST /api/collection-gap-plan` for Planning Lab collection gaps
- `POST /api/taste-profile` for Planning Lab taste-fit recommendations
- `POST /api/person-watch-path` for Planning Lab person watch paths
- `GET /health` for deployment health
- `POST /mcp` for remote MCP clients

Agents can call `get_weekend_watchlist` with:

- `mood`: `crowd`, `thriller`, `thoughtful`, `funny`, `family`, or `mindbend`
- `country`: watch-provider region, for example `IN` or `US`
- `language`: original language code, for example `en`, `hi`, `ta`, `te`, or `any`
- `runtime`: maximum minutes, for example `120`, `150`, or `any`
- `minRating`: minimum TMDB rating
- `services`: preferred streaming services
- `familySafe`: set to `true` to exclude common mature genres when TMDB genre data is available

Agents can call `plan_watch_party` when the decision is for a group. It accepts:

- `moods`: one to three values from `crowd`, `thriller`, `thoughtful`, `funny`, `family`, or `mindbend`
- `groupSize`: number of people watching
- `country`, `language`, `runtime`, `minRating`, and `services`: same meaning as the weekend watchlist
- `avoidTitles`: titles the group has already seen or wants excluded
- `familySafe`: set to `true` to exclude common mature genres when TMDB genre data is available

Agents can call `build_franchise_watch_order` for a collection or universe guide. It accepts:

- `query`: franchise or collection name, for example `The Matrix`, `Dune`, `Batman`, or `Mission Impossible`
- `country`: watch-provider region, for example `IN` or `US`
- `maxMovies`: maximum collection entries to include, from 2 to 20

Agents can call `build_collection_gap_plan` for franchise completion planning. It accepts:

- `query`: franchise or collection name
- `watchedTitles`: watched titles or TMDB movie IDs
- `country`: watch-provider region, for example `IN` or `US`
- `services`: preferred streaming services
- `maxMovies`: maximum collection entries to include, from 2 to 20

Agents can call `recommend_from_taste_profile` for personalized recommendations. It accepts:

- `likedTitles`: one to five movies the user likes
- `dislikedTitles`: optional movies the user dislikes or wants to avoid stylistically
- `country`, `services`, `language`, `runtime`, and `minRating`: filters and watch-now preferences
- `maxResults`: number of recommendations to return, from 3 to 10

Agents can call `build_person_watch_path` for an actor, director, writer, or crew member. It accepts:

- `name`: person name, for example `Keanu Reeves` or `Christopher Nolan`
- `country`: watch-provider region, for example `IN` or `US`
- `services`: preferred streaming services
- `maxTitles`: number of watch-path entries to return, from 3 to 8

## Cloudflare MCP Demo Workflow

For a concrete end-to-end agent workflow, run the now-playing follow-on demo. It uses the MCP server as a remote client would:

1. `get_now_playing` for current theater discovery in a selected region
2. `get_movie_details` for the selected title
3. `get_watch_providers` for watch-now availability
4. `get_recommendations`, with `get_similar_movies` fallback for very new titles
5. `get_watch_providers` for follow-on availability checks

Local stdio MCP:

```bash
npm run build
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && npm run demo:now-playing -- --region US
```

Cloudflare-hosted MCP:

```bash
TMDB_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token> node scripts/now-playing-follow-on-demo.mjs --mcp-url https://tmdb-mcp.<your-workers-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp --region US
```

The script writes the final artifact here:

```text
examples/now-playing-follow-on-demo.md
```

## What `npm run install:local` does

The installer uses the repo-owned launcher at `plugins/tmdb/scripts/run-server.sh`.

For Codex it:

- Registers the launcher as an MCP server
- Installs a local `TMDB` plugin payload so it appears in the plugin UI

For Claude Desktop it:

- Registers the same launcher as a local MCP server

It updates:

- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `~/.codex/.tmp/plugins/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- `~/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated/tmdb/...`
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

The launcher reads `TMDB_API_KEY` from your shell environment or from the repo `.env` file.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

If you prefer manual setup, add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tmdb-local": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/mcp-server-tmdb/plugins/tmdb/scripts/run-server.sh",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config.

## Usage with Codex

The installer adds these blocks to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.tmdb_local]
command = "/full/path/to/mcp-server-tmdb/plugins/tmdb/scripts/run-server.sh"

[plugins."tmdb@openai-curated"]
enabled = true
```

Restart Codex after editing the config. In a fresh Codex session, `TMDB` should appear in the plugin list and contribute the `mcp__tmdb__` namespace.

## Validation

Offline smoke test:

```bash
TMDB_API_KEY=dummy node plugins/tmdb/scripts/smoke-test.mjs
```

Online smoke test:

```bash
set -a && source ./.env && set +a && node plugins/tmdb/scripts/smoke-test.mjs --online
```

## Plugin Docs

For plugin packaging, local install behavior, and Codex-specific notes, see `plugins/tmdb/README.md`.

## Usage with BizClaw / NanoClaw

Built into the agent container. Just set `TMDB_API_KEY` in your `.env` file — no configuration needed.

## Example Prompts
